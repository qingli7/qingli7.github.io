I am a postdoc of Prof. [Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications under a joint project at the Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. And I had a one-year [internship](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/People/LiQing.html) at the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition of the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my master`s degree and bachelor’s degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 and Sichuan Normal University in 2016 respectively. My current research interests include machine learning, healthcare and bioinformatics, big data analysis, and evolutionary computing, in which I have published papers in SCI Information Sciences, Journal of Big Data, CCF SMC, and IEEE ICCSN, etc, and served as a reviewer for many essential journals and conferences such as IEEE/CAA Neurocomputing, JAS, CCF SMC, etc.
